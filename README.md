### What is HTML?
HTML is the language of the web. It is just text characters that the browser can read and convert into the websites we see today. Much like how only humans who know how to read English are able to read and understand a book written in English, browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer are able to read simple text in the form of HTML.

#### Tags to note
* html
* body
* head
* div
* h1-6
* p
* img
* a
* ul/ol
* li

### What is CSS?
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets are documents that tell your browser how to style your website. What colors your fonts should have. How big to make your H1s and how small your H6s should be. CSS is written from the top down. So your most global styles should be located at the top fo the file and your more focused styles should come toward the bottom.

#### Properties to note
* background-color
* box-shadow
* color
* display
* font-family
* font-size
* font-weight
* margin
* overflow
* padding
* text-align
* text-transform

### Deploying
To ship our site we are going to use a web application called [Forge](https://www.getforge.com).

#### How to deploy
* Compress your site's folder into a zip file
* Create a new site or click on an existing site in the lefthand sidebar
* Drag and drop the zip file into the web browser
* Wait for it ... Boom your site is now live

You can click on the site's URL in the top navigation bar to see the live product.
